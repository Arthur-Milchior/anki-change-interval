# Percent

Here, null means that you'll be asked what percent to use. If you enter a number, it'll always be used, and you won't be asked anything.

# Consider last review date

There are two intervals we can consider. Either the interval between the due date and today, or the interval between the due date and the last review. The first one is obtained by setting this value to false, and ensure that no card will be late. The second one, obtained by setting this value to true, ensure that the due date will now be the one you'd have if the value of «interval modifier» was changed the last time you reviewed those cards.

# Also change late cards

Do you want to also change the due date of cards which are late? If you use a percent greater than 100, and that you consider last review date, some cards may stop being late. In every other case, this does not seems really interesting.
